# Running the stub server

The stub server is a small python application for frontend development.
It can be initialized using the following commands in a bash shell.

```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Whenever you want to work on the project you should run

```
virtualenv venv/bin/activate
```

And then you can start the server (in the same shell) using

```
python stubserver.py
```
